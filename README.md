===============================

The object of the game is to move the player, who starts on the green grass at bottom of screen,
to river at top of screen.

To accomplish this goal, the player must avoid the ladybugs that travel along the road.  Ladybugs stay in a
lane, but move at random velocities.

Player movement is controlled by the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move the player in
correspondind directions.

If player fails to avoid the ladybug and a collision occurs, the player returns to the starting point.

If player reaches the river, the player returns to the starting point, and an additional lady bug is
added to the game to make it more challenging.

There is no end of the game.
